# Multithreading_in_python
Multithreading in Python is a technique that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process. This can help perform tasks in parallel, making the program more efficient, especially when dealing with I/O-bound tasks such as reading/writing files, handling network requests, or waiting for user input.
